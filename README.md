## Description

Hey! Hello! And welcome to WikiFood. Where you can find all about your favourite foods, in just one place.

WikiFood it's a wiki about gastronomy. Maybe you want to know how much a dish costs? You got it. You wanna know how much time does that dish need to be prepared? You also got it. A recipe? Welp, you got it! Everything from information about any specific recipe, to even videos about how to make those recipes, you'll find it.

This page works with a free API called Spoonacular. This is where I've collected all the information about all the different foods. Without them, this could has not been possible. More information about them and its API on: https://spoonacular.com/food-api

But hey! There's much more! You can even create your account, personalize it at your own choice, see if some wine could go well with some recipe, and even more; save your favourite articles!

### So, what are you waiting for? Come to WikiFood! And be part of the kitchen.
